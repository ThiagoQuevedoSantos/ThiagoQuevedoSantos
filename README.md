 🕹 I'm 16 years old and I've been studying programming for 5 months.<br>
👓 I'm currently studying Java for backend desktop applications and frontend web development.<br>
💻 I take the Computer Technician course (with Java programming, networking and computer maintenance and assembly curricular units) at [Senac Tech](https://www.senacrs.com.br/cursosDetalheTurmas.asp?idCurso=1468&unidade=18&nivelcurso=tecnicos) and I have a scholarship in the [#TeuFuturo](https://www.imed.edu.br/Comunicacao/Eventos/Hotsite/-teufuturo/) program (which offers specialization in web development).<br>
